## My PR as an engineer
Since I was a student, I have been working for my personal projects. I always communicate with users, in both my current job and my personal projects. The user experience is the most important thing in my development.

Through my experience at my current job, I have acquired the know-how of development that emphasizes readability and maintainability. I can develop apps that users can trust and use.

I am confident with communicating smoothly with non-Japanese people, other departments, and within the development organization. I can collaborate and contribute to the results as a team, whether in a small or large organization.

Also, I have contributed to the skill improvement of team members through pull request reviews, catching up and sharing the latest technologies, and so on. I can lead the growth of not only myself, but also the team.
